This app is made by following tutorial https://youtu.be/wUAUdEw5oxM

## project intro
In this project, we will be exploring Langchain, a powerful natural language processing tool, to create a ChatGPT for your PDF documents. We will be using Streamlit, a popular Python web framework, to build an interactive application that enables users to ask questions about a given PDF document and receive answers directly from an LLM (Large Language Model), such as OpenAI's ChatGPT. Through this project, we will learn how to leverage Langchain's capabilities to enhance the functionality of our Streamlit app, and how to harness the power of language models to provide users with a seamless and intuitive PDF reading experience.
